### Task 3: Metrics and performance evaluation:
Evaluation metrics : These are the tools which helps us assess the accuracy of the machine learning models. We will be looking into
- Regression metrics and classification metrics

#### Regression metrics:
- These are the tools which helps us assess the regression model and its accuracy.
Some of them are
- Mean absolute error
- Mean squarred error
- Root mean squarred error

#### Classification metrics
- These are the tools which helps us test the accuracy or various factors of correctness of a classification model
some of them are
- Accuracy: no. of correct predictions divided by all instances
- Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions and all positive predictions
- Recall: This focuses on the completeness of correct predictions

We will one of each types of evaluation metrics to evaluate our hand crafted models of task 4.
