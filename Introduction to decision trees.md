Decision trees come under supervised machine learning algorithms and they are one of the most used 
algorithms in the world. Decision trees can be used to solve regression as well as classification 
problems. Decision trees structure contain root node, branches and leaf node. A node holds the value
of a class label whereas branches denotes outcome. Decision trees are also knowm as classification 
and regression trees abbreiveted as **CART**.
