The first part of the task is to perform curve fitting on a set of data. Curve fitting is the
process of finding a mathematical function in an analytic form that best fits this set of data.

The data:

The curve:

## Fourier Transform:
In physics and mathematics, the Fourier transform (FT) is a transform that converts a function into a form that describes the frequencies present in the original function. The output of the transform is a complex-valued function of frequency.

The following code prints the graph of a function which is combination of 2 sine functions of different frequency,

however we can see what those frequencies are without explicitly knowing it beforehand, through fourier transform.

We can see that the frequencies are 50 and 80.
