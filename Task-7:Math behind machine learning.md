The first part of the task is to perform curve fitting on a set of data. Curve fitting is the
process of finding a mathematical function in an analytic form that best fits this set of data.

The data:

Fourier Transform:
In physics and mathematics, the Fourier transform (FT) is a transform that converts a function into a form that describes the frequencies present in the original function. The output of the transform is a complex-valued function of frequency
